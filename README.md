# Postman Portfolio

This portfolio contains collections and API environments created in Postman.

Since I cannot show the real project, a public resource will be used here.

In this project I implemented:
- User creation
- Using a token for authorization
- Using random data to create a cycle {{$randomDate}}
- Using GET, POST, PUT, DEL methods
- Using the environment to substitute data into fields
- Writing scripts to check the response and replace data in each loop


## Collection

- [Collection 1](collections/Dummy.postman_collection.json)


## Environments

- [Environment 1](environments/DummyAPI.postman_environment.json)

## How to use

1. Download the desired collection and/or environment.
2. Import the file into Postman.

4. Run queries from the collection.
